{"name":"GhostDriver","body":"### Forewords\r\nAs it stands now, GhostDriver is a technical-demo. I worked on this 1 week and the idea is to present it to the [Selenium Conference 2012](http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#IDM). It's not usable as a normal WebDriver yet, but it will be in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n### Important, please read\r\n0. IT'S NOT DONE! The only commands implemented are the one used by the examples/google_cheese/ directory\r\n1. It's still experimental\r\n2. Not ready for Production\r\n3. Only 13 of the >90 WireProtocol Commands implemented\r\n4. I released it to get people interested in contributing. Not to provide a solution: it's not ready yet!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Example (the only available so far :) )\r\nThere is plenty to do before this is usable, but if you can't wait to try PhantomJS's speed when it acts as a RemoteWebDriver Server, do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Start GhostDriver on the terminal\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ phantomjs ghostdriver/main.js\r\nGhost Driver running on port 8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Build and Launch the first Java-based example (Maven required):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd ghostdriver/examples/google_cheese/\r\n$ ./mvnexec-server-online.sh ghostdriver\r\n...\r\n[INFO] Building ghostdriver 1.0\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] >>> exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:java (default-cli) @ google_cheese >>>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] <<< exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:java (default-cli) @ google_cheese <<<\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:java (default-cli) @ google_cheese ---\r\n*** USING GHOSTDRIVER ***\r\nLoading 'http://www.google.com'...\r\nLoaded.
